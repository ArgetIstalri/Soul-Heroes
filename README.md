## Creating your first Hero Pack!

Before starting, we suggest using a text editor other than the one that came with your computer. The only real reason is you'll be managing a lot of files at once, and that can get hectic with normal notepad.

Suggested Text Editors:

Atom (Full markdown Editor with support for all languages) - https://atom.io/

Notepad++ (Source code Editor to replace Notepad) - https://notepad-plus-plus.org/

We also suggest that you get some sort of photo editor other than MS Paint, there's plenty of free options out there, but if you'd like you could use some high end like Adobe Photoshop

Suggested Photo Editors:

Paint.net (Image and photo editing software for Windows) - https://www.getpaint.net/

Gimp (Image Manipulator) - https://www.gimp.org/
### Getting Started

  # You can leave comments in these files if you'd like. Just use a # so it's ignored during runtime.
  "name": "My First Hero Pack",
  # You can leave this blank or remove it entirely if you don't plan on adding in any suit alts.
  "alts": {
